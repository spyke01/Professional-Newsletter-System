Description:
----------------------------------
Fast Track Sites developed the Fast Track Sites Blogging Technology System (FTSBTS) to allow users to easily create websites of their own with no programming required. FTSBTS was designed to be simple and easy to use. it is designed to be able to be installed and have a working site within seconds. 

The FREE version of FTSBTS has several features that allow users to create a fully functional and customizable web site. It includes a few of the original items that only FTSBTS comes with by default. The professional version comes with two skins, or themes if you will, that will give you a basic idea on how to make new ones. 

The professional version includes a 1yr warranty with full access to technical support by phone or email, multiple ways to create web pages, and much, much more. One of the biggest changes to the FTSBTS system that Fast Track Sites has made is the addition of the What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) page editor. It allows you to see the basic look of your website without saving and loading it back up. 

FTSBTS sells for much less than other high priced content management systems with equal or less features.

Installation:
----------------------------------
Extract the files to your web directory.
Chmod _db.php to 777
Chmod .htaccess to 777
Fill out all of your information and submit the form.
Delete install.php
Chmod _db.php to 755
Chmod .htaccess to 755
Enjoy!

Editing Database Connection Settings:
------------------------------------------ 
In rare cases, the installer will be unable to create the _db.php file correctly, this is usually because of the file not being chmodded correctly.

If this happens, you will need to manually edit _db.php for your db settings.

Editing .htaccess Settings:
------------------------------------------ 
In rare cases, the installer will be unable to create the .htaccess file correctly, this is usually because of the file not being chmodded correctly.

If this happens, you will need to manually edit .htaccess and set RewriteBase to the correct path. An eample is:

The blog is located at http://www.yourserver.com/path/to/script/
RewriteBase should be set to /path/to/script/
